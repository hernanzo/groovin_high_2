This episode analyzes the materiality of the musical notation, as a non-verbal means to express a particular sonic event: a tune. As a symbolic language, the fonts, typographies, symbols, but also the marks and handwritten notes added by previous users, will be conceived as incitements to create and reproduce a sonic object. The interaction between these symbols and musicians through the Real Book creates a twofold roadmap, which includes both the reproduction of a set of melodies, but also for the background for musical improvisation and creation. This episode will anchor the history of the shifting musical practices and their musicological aspects, on the materiality of the musical notation.
