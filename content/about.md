Groovin' High analyzes a copy of the Real Book, as a non-sonic component of the practice of music. The Real Book, originally compiled by two students at the Berklee School of Music in the 1970s, is a compilation of lead sheets of popular songs that specify the basic elements of a composition: melody, lyrics, chord changes and structure. The Real Book was created as an update of the fake books, which were widely used by U.S. professional musicians to “fake it”, that is, to perform a song for an audience without a full score, and by displaying a great deal of improvisation over the basic elements of a song. 
The whole idea of the project starts from the object itself: a used copy of the sixth edition of the Real Book, published by Hal Leonard most likely in 2004, bought in ebay. The project attempts to use the Real Book’s materiality as a pathway to explore its usages, multiple meanings, and its historical background. I argue that physical attributes of the object are not stagnant matter; quite the contrary, each component offers a kaleidoscopical view, for it reflects an ever-changing combination of possible paths of interpretation. Following Karen Harvey, I understand material culture not only as encapsulating “the physical attributes of an object, but the myriad and shifting contexts through which it acquires meaning.” I conceive the physicality of the Real Book like a tissue, whose fibers are networks of connections that can be material or immaterial, insofar they intertwine textures, crafts, and functions, with ideas, imaginaries and fictions
