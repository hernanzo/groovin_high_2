The first chapter will analyze the mechanics of the materiality of the Real Book; its gutter, its pagination, its binding, and its front and back covers will be conceptualized as prompts to action for an user. As exhortations for musicians to take certain actions, these elements were also designed to contain an inner property of materiality in action: its decay. The episode will try to uncover the changing historical contexts in which these actions were supposed to take place; from the 1940â€™s gigging professional musicians looking to be up-to-date with a popular musical repertoire, to contemporary students trying to learn the common places of a centenary songbook.
