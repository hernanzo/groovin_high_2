Groovin' High analyzes a copy of the Real Book, as a non-sonic component of the practice of music. The Real Book, originally compiled by two students at the Berklee School of Music in the 1970s, is a compilation of lead sheets of popular songs that specify the basic elements of a composition: melody, lyrics, chord changes and structure. The Real Book was created as an update of the fake books, which were widely used by U.S. professional musicians to “fake it”, that is, to perform a song for an audience without a full score, and by displaying a great deal of improvisation over the basic elements of a song.
